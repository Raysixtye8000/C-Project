    <h3> An Elite Highschool student </h3>

    <ul> <li> Educational Career </li> </ul>

    <p> An Elite highschool student. <br> 
    The curriculum an Elite student undergoes is on par with 
    that of a university's in his <br> second year and above. If an Elite
    student and a university's first year student took <br> the 
    same test, the Elite student would probably hold the advantage due to the
    demanding <br> curriculum of an Elite student.</p>

    <ul> <li> Experience as a Programmer </li> </ul>

    <p>I'm under the process of polishing my skills as a programmer. I've
    got the required <br> experience in python to build a bunch of humble projects 
    such as a calculator, a <br> CeaserCipher, the game BlackJack, the game Hangman, 
    other Interactive games, and a <br> coffee machine. <br>
    I'm currently intending to master front-end webdevelopment. I've been
    working on my <br> coding skills regarding the development of websites by
    the use of HTML as of late, and I'm <br> planning  to begin learning the mechanisms of 
    CSS during the next few days.
